
`cpytoken` is a copy of the CPython tokenizer as a Python C-Extension module.
Note that since it's lifted straight from python it's generally only compatible
with the version is was lifted from. This version should should be build-able
in 3.8-3.10.

It's just used for benchmarking against `woosh` and is not normally installed
with `woosh`.
